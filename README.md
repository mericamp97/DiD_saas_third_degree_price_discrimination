# Overview
This repository hosts a detailed analysis focusing on third-degree price discrimination using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach. The goal of this analysis is to understand and quantify the impact of a software firm's pricing strategy on different customer segments, specifically in the education and business sectors. Through this analysis, we aim to identify whether price discrimination based on customer segments (education vs. business) can lead to increased revenue for the firm while maintaining customer satisfaction and market competitiveness. The analysis carefully considers the variation in price elasticity between these sectors and how this affects the firmâ€™s pricing decisions. The investigation is crucial in aiding the software firm to refine its pricing strategy, potentially leading to better financial performance and customer relationship management
